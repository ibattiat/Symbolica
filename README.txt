To run the provided examples:

	1. Open "Symbolica.nb" using Mathematica.

	2. Specify the directory containing "Symbolica.nb" and all necessary functions in the variable "directory" under the section "Import Necessary Packages".

	3. Specify the input file in the variable "inputNotebookName" under the section "Run Input File". The file names for the two example cases are provided (commented-out). Un-comment the name corresponding to the desired case to be run.

	4. Evaluate the notebook by selecting the "Evaluate Notebook" option from the "Evaluation" tab at the top of the window. Symbolica will run and display the output file in around 18 seconds for problem 1, and around 7 minutes for problem 2. This file contains the multiple outputs (e.g., the upscaled equations, closure problems, dimensionless numbers, closure variables, etc.)

	5. Before re-running or testing another input, quit the local kernel. This can be done by finding the "Quit Kernel" option from the "Evaluation" tab at the top of the window, and selecting the "Local" option. This will help avoid mixing previous results with those of the new inputs.
